Project Introduction:
  
  Please provide a brief description of your project. List the goals and objectives of your project and explain why you’ve chosen to work on this project.

Technical Overview:
  
  Please provide a moderate-length technical description of the major components of your project. This should also function as a sort of ‘roadmap’ for tasks you need     to complete for your project to be functional.
  Please list what you plan to have finished by each checkpoint. These are meant to be goals to keep your project on track. We will NOT grade your checkpoints on how      much you have completed, but on whether or not you’ve made some progress.

Possible Challenges:

1. Gaining experience working with ML models in Rust
2. Learning the time series and knn crates in Rust
3. Learning to work with Rusty Machine, a general purpose machine learning library for Rust
4. Parsing data and working with large datasets in Rust
5. Analyzing predictions to draw meaningful conclusions about energy production and consumption

References:

We will draw some inspiration from the homework about the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in order to implement our own ML algorithms for our project. Additionally, we will be using the following crates and libraries:

1. timeseries: https://docs.rs/timeseries/latest/timeseries/
2. knn: https://docs.rs/knn/latest/knn/ 
3. Rusty Machine: https://athemathmo.github.io/rusty-machine/doc/rusty_machine/index.html
